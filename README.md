# DevX GPT-CLI
This is a Command Line Interface that can be used to interact with OpenAI's API.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo onto your machine
2. Add your API Key to a .env file

Example:

.env should contain

```
OPENAI_KEY = sk-yourSecretKey
```

You want to make sure this key is not shared, .env is in .gitignore by default.

3. Place your prompt into Prompt.txt
4. If you plan to use "edit", place your text to modify in Input.txt
5. If you plan to "chat", place your system instruction in Input.txt instead.
5. Start the CLI
    
```
cd GPT-CLI
python UseAPI.py
```

6. Follow the prompts and get a response from Chat-GPT!

| chat        | Have an interactive chat with Chat-GPT similar to the online UI |

davinci is considered the "smartest" model.

If your use case is "edit", the model will be preset for you.

Temperature controls the "creativity" of the response generated by ChatGPT.
A temperature of 1.0 results in the most "creative" responses.
